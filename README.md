# Supply Chain Data Warehouse & Analytics Platform

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a modern Supply Chain Data Warehouse using PostgreSQL, Python ETL pipelines, SQL analytics, and Power BI dashboards.

The system simulates supply chain operations by generating synthetic data for products, suppliers, warehouses, and orders. The data is transformed and loaded into a dimensional warehouse modeled using a Star Schema, enabling efficient business analytics and reporting.

---

## Objectives

* Design a scalable dimensional data warehouse.
* Implement ETL pipelines using Python.
* Load and manage data in PostgreSQL.
* Perform analytical SQL queries for business insights.
* Build an interactive Power BI dashboard for decision-making.

## ETL Pipeline

### Extract

Synthetic supply chain data is generated using the Faker library.

### Transform

Data is validated and structured using Pandas.

### Load

Data is loaded into PostgreSQL dimension and fact tables using SQLAlchemy.

## Analytical SQL Queries

The project includes business-oriented analytical queries such as:

* Revenue by Product Category
* Monthly Revenue Trends
* Top Revenue Generating Products
* Supplier Performance Analysis
* Warehouse Performance Analysis
* Category Revenue Contribution
* Top Product in Each Category

Advanced SQL concepts used:

* Joins
* Aggregations
* Window Functions
* Ranking Functions
* Common Table Expressions (CTEs)

---

## Power BI Dashboard

The Power BI dashboard provides:

### Key Performance Indicators

* Total Revenue
* Total Orders
* Average Order Value

### Business Insights

* Revenue by Category
* Monthly Revenue Trend
* Top Products
* Supplier Performance
* Warehouse Performance

### Dashboard Preview
